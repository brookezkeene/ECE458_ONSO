# ECE458_ONSO

Senior design project completed through the course Engineering Software for Maintainability (ECE 458) at Duke University, taught by Tyler Bletsch. My team consisted of myself and 3 other students enrolled in the course. Our goal was to create an IT managment system for a hypothetical small/midsize company called "Hyposoft" that would track the company's model and asset usage across one or multiple datacenters. 

For our system, we chose to create a web-based solution using ASP.NET for our backend infrastructure and Vue.js as our frontend framework. This repository contains the code from our final submission for the project.
